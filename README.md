# SavedInstanceTracker
SavedInstanceTracker is an addon written for World of Warcraft Classic with the intention of simplifying tracking of instance lockouts.
Due to the limitations of the WoW API lockout tracking is not 100% perfect and might require some user input for perfect lockout tracking. 

<b>Commands:</b></br>
/saved - Prints a list of all active instance lockouts.</br>
/saved ? or help - Lists all available commands.</br>
/saved soft - Preforms a soft reset telling the addon to expect a fresh instance the next time a dungeon is entered.</br>
