# SavedInstanceTracker
SavedInstanceTracker is an addon written for World of Warcraft Classic with the intention of simplifying tracking of instance lockouts.
Due to the limitations of the WoW API lockout tracking is not 100% perfect and might require some user input for perfect lockout tracking. 

<b>Commands:</b></br>
/sav - Prints a list of all active instance lockouts.</br>
/sav reset - Forces a new entry of the current instance.</br>
/sav softreset - Preforms a soft reset telling the addon to expect a fresh instance the next time a dungeon is entered.</br>
/sav request - Request an automatic reset from the leader when possible.</br>
/sav allowRequest - Toggles between allowing and disallowing party members to request resets.</br>
/sav ? or help - Lists all available commands.</br>
